Examples
========

warehouse
---------

A sample warehouse with fake data, to demonstrate the features of
Pallet Jack.


palletjack_yaml_file.py
-----------------------

Salt external pillar for reading YAML files containing data exported
from the warehouse by palletjack2salt.

Place this file in your Salt pillar module directory, e.g.
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/pillar/, and use it by adding
this to your Salt master configuration:

  ext_pillar:
    - palletjack_yaml_file: /var/cache/palletjack/{environment}/{minion}.yaml

Then, install a Git hook that runs palletjack2salt after the warehouse
has been updated.
