IP network
==========

Type name: ip_network

Represents an IPv4 network.

The name of an ip_network object is the netblock definition in CIDR
notation, with the / replaced with an _, e.g. "192.168.0.0_24". The
default transform rules fill in values for "net.ip.cidr" and
"net.ip.prefixlen" from the name. Mask lengths not a multiple of 8
bits are allowed here, but are not yet supported by "palletjack2zone"
for writing reverse zones.

This information is used by most tools handling network configuration,
currently "palletjack2kea" and "palletjack2zone".
