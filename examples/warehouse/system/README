System
======

Type name: system

Represents a running operating system instance.

The name of a system object is its network hostname, which the default
transforms will combine with the DNS domain to produce a full name in
the key "net.dns.fqdn".

The link "domain" points to the DNS domain this system is a part of.

The link "machine" points to the machine this system runs on, either a
physical machine, a virtual machine or a container.

The link "os" points to the operating system this system runs.

role.yaml contains, in the key "system.role", a list of roles which
this system skall have, which in the future will be made available to
the configuration management system.
