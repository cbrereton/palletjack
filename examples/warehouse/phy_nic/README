Physical NIC
============

Type name: phy_nic

Represents an Ethernet network interface card.

The name of a NIC is its Ethernet MAC address, with bytes separated by
":". The default transform rules copy the MAC address to
"net.layer2.address".

For a physical network interface, the link "chassis" points to the
chassis in which that interface lives and the key "chassis.nic.port"
contains the physical port number in the chassis. For virtual
networks, the link "phy_nic" points to the physical interface on which
they run.
