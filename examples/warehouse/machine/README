Machine
=======

Type name: machine

Represents the substrate for running an operating system.

A machine can be physical hardware running one system image (e.g. one
desktop computer or one blade in a blade chassis), a virtual machine,
or a container.

For a physical machine, the link "chassis" points to the chassis in
which that machine lives. For virtual machines and containers, the
link "host" points to the system which hosts them.
