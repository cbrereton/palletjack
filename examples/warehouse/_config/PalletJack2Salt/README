PalletJack2Salt Configuration
=============================

Keys under `pillar.global.*` are used to store information about which
kinds of pallets to copy into global Salt pillars under the name space
`palletjack:global`.

  - For pallet kinds listed under `.each-pallet`, the entire hierarchy
    of pallets is copied.

  - For pallet kinds listed under `.each-leaf-pallet`, only leaves in
    the hierarchy are copied, i.e. pallets without children of their
    own kind.

Keys under `pillar.per-minion.each-subtree` are used to store information
about which key subtrees to copy from each `system` object into
per-minion Salt pillars under the name space `palletjack`.
