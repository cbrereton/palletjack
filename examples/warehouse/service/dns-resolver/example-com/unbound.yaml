# The unbound DNS resolver <https://unbound.net/> has a simple
# key-value configuration structure with top-level categories and
# underlying key-value items.  The YAML structure mirrors this.
#
# Value lists are represented as repeated key-values.  The Unbound
# configuration format requires string values to be surrounded by
# double quotes. To preserve them through the YAML parser, surround
# the entire value with single quotes.
