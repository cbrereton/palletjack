# The unbound DNS resolver <https://unbound.net/> has a simple
# key-value configuration structure with top-level categories and
# underlying key-value items.  The YAML structure mirrors this.
#
# Value lists are represented as repeted key-values.  Strings in
# unbound config are double-quoted, so any quoting in the YAML
# structure should use single-quoutes to prevent confusion.
