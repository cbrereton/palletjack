Domain
======

Type name: domain

Represents a DNS domain.

The link "ipv4_network" points to the IPv4 network corresponding to
this DNS domain.

The information in "dns.yaml" is used by the tools "palletjack2kea",
to write the domain name in the DHCP configuration, and
"palletjack2zone", to write zone files for a DNS server. If the
ipv4_network link points to a network which has its netblock in CIDR
form in the key "net.ipv4.cidr", and the netmask length is a whole
number of octets (i.e. 0, 8, 16 or 24 bits), "palletjack2zone" will
also write reverse zones for all defined IP addresses.

The information in "services.yaml" is used by "palletjack2salt" to
write Salt pillar data pointing to services available in the domain.
