Chassis
=======

Type name: chassis

Represents a physical computer chassis. For a desktop computer, it
will contain a single machine object. For a server, it will contain
two machine objects, one for the main system and one for the service
module. For a blade chassis, each blade will be a machine object, and
one for the chassis service module.

The link "rack" points to the rack in which the chassis is mounted.

Currently, no tools have any requirements on the formatting of this
data. However, the following structure is recommended:


Files:

  chassis/<name>/identity.yaml
  chassis/<name>/location.yaml


Links:

  chassis/<name>/rack -> ../../rack/<name>/


YAML:

identity.yaml:
  chassis:
    manufacturer: Human-readable manufacturer name
    model: Human-readable model name
    serial: Serial number
    max-power: Nominal maximum power draw in watts

location.yaml:
  location:
    position:
      slot: Slot number of lowest rack slot occupied
      height: Chassis height in rack units
      front: True if this chassis blocks the front of the rack
      rear: True if this chassis blocks the rear of the rack
