IP interface
============

Type name: ip_interface

Represents an IP configuration on a network interface.

Each ip_interface has exactly one IPv4 address, which is its name. To
configure several IP addresses on the same physical interface, create
additional ip_interface objects with links to the same phy_nic object.

The link "domain" points to the DNS domain this interface is a part
of.

The link "ip_network" points to the IP network this interface is
attached to.

The link "phy_nic" points to the underlying Ethernet interface this IP
interface runs on.

The link "system" points to the system in which this interface is
configured.

This information is used by all tools handling network configuration,
currently "palletjack2kea", "palletjack2pxelinux" and
"palletjack2zone".

The phy_nic linked from this ip_interface may be a virtual interface,
if the system runs on a virtual machine.


Links:

  ip_interface/<name>/domain -> ../../domain/<name>/
  ip_interface/<name>/ip_network -> ../../ip_network/<name>/
  ip_interface/<name>/phy_nic -> ../../phy_nic/<name>/
  ip_interface/<name>/system -> ../../system/<name>/
